# DFTOOLS
Drakkar Forcing TOOLS
## Purpose:
This repository contains a set of tools that were developped in the DRAKKAR project aiming at preparing the atmospheric forcing. Utilities regarding the download of atmospheric re-analysis as well as the reshaping of some files for NEMO ( for instance, compute humidity from dewpoint temperature and mean sea level pressure, or decumulating some fluxes --ssrd, strd, precip, snow--, changing units etc...). 
## History:
These tools were previously maintained on the LEGI forge under the DRAKKAR trac system.
